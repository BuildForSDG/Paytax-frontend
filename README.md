##  PROBLEM STATEMENT

Develop a tech solution to help improve revenue collection within your local government/community.

## PROBLEM

Tax and other Revenue collection.

## INTRODUCTION

In developing countries and under developed countries, such as many african countries, collection of data and data management of individuals and businesses has been a major problem. This is due to the lack of sensitization, as many individuals in these african countries have not been enlightened as to the importance.

Data collection in most cases is quite frankly for the government and the society at large as this can contribute immensely to economic growth and developement.

When a government or society is able to have at leat over 80 percent of individual data, it will be able to know those that are employed and unemployed. An adequate data of it's employed citizens or business owners, will enable the governmet to monitor tax payers.

This is what has brought about this proposed system, which is geared towards collection of individual data of working citizens, business owners and industries which inturn will monitor tax payment and other internal generated revenue.

With this in view, tax payemnt and income revenue for states and countries will greatly improve. This will help the government to provide and bring adequate and necessary development to it's citizens.

## SOLUTION/PROJECT

To develop an app, that will help in data collection of working citizen or salary earners in the community, business owners and industries. This Application aims to enhance the process of tax collection with a platform that allows for a seamless tax payment. This system will monitor tax payment and revenue collection.

This platform also is geared towards a hassle free mode of taxpayment and revenue generation. It aims at reducing the stress of already paying individuals and customers and also an ease of access to those coming on board.

The platform also provides a means where every tax payer can monitor their previous payments, generate receipts and also have it sent to their mails. They will also have the opportunity to update their income incase of any upgrade or downgrade.

The system also aims at flexibility. It also aims at collecting indivial bank details, working with relevant authorities that will notify of any direct deduction from bank accounts in the event of delay or non-compliance.

## Setup

Install `npm` or `yarn` if you dont have any of them already installed. We recommend Yarn though.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies.

`src/server.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `**tests**' folder. There's a sample in there.

## Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to get started. We'll assume you are using Yarn.

- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`

- Run tests: `yarn test`

- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`

- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`

- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:3000, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.
